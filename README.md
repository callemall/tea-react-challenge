## Setup

1. Visit the [Open Movie Database](https://www.omdbapi.com) a.k.a OMDB.
2. Request an API key from [this page](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
3. The API key will be emailed to you. Make sure to verify the token via the emailed link.

- Optionally, add your project to an online Git repository. Although this is not required, it is our preferred method to review your code.
  - Note: Please do not attempt to add your code to this repo (through a fork or PR) as this would make your solution visible to others.
